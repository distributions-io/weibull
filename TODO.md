TODO
====

1. README urls
2. MGF example
3. tidy up example code
4. 
5. determine whether `shape` and `scale` should be used rather than `lambda` and `k`
	-	should `lambda` and `k` be aliased as `shape` and `scale`
6. README eqns
7. methods should take an `options` object similar to, e.g., `erf`, etc, which allows for `dtype`, `accessor`, `path`, etc.
	- see `pdf`
8. for pdf, cdf, quantile, a method which precomputes quantities such as Math.log( lambda ), etc, as these will not change.
9. fcn [signature](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/normpdf.html)
10. `toString()` method
11. `toJSON()` method
12. ability to partially apply methods?
13. distributions methods
	-	mean
	- 	variance
	-	iqr
	-	...
	-	take a dist instance and compute the quantity
14. sep mod pdf, wrap ctx, and use bound vals
15.
